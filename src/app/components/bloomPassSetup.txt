To achieve the glowing bloom effect like the image, you need to use THREE.js postprocessing. Please run the following command in your project root to install the required dependencies:

npm install three @types/three three-stdlib

Then, update your HeroIcosahedron.tsx as follows:

1. Import the postprocessing modules:

import { EffectComposer } from 'three-stdlib/postprocessing/EffectComposer';
import { RenderPass } from 'three-stdlib/postprocessing/RenderPass';
import { UnrealBloomPass } from 'three-stdlib/postprocessing/UnrealBloomPass';

2. Replace the renderer.render(scene, camera) call in your animate function with composer.render().

3. Set up the composer and passes after creating the renderer:

const composer = new EffectComposer(renderer);
const renderPass = new RenderPass(scene, camera);
const bloomPass = new UnrealBloomPass(
  new THREE.Vector2(container.offsetWidth, container.offsetHeight),
  2.0, // strength
  1.5, // radius
  0.0  // threshold
);
composer.addPass(renderPass);
composer.addPass(bloomPass);

4. In the handleResize function, also update the composer size:
composer.setSize(container.offsetWidth, container.offsetHeight);

This will give you a strong, soft bloom effect like the image. If you want, I can apply these changes directly to your file.
